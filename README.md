A RESTful API built with Laravel 12 for managing events, attendees, and bookings.

## Features

- Attendee Registration
- Event Booking with:
  - No duplicate bookings
  - No overbooking (enforces capacity limit)
- Structure for Authentication (not implemented)
- Proper Validation, Clean Architecture
- API Resources for clean responses
- Service Layer for business logic
- Testing support (Feature and Unit)

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/event-booking-api.git
cd event-booking-api
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```

```

### 4. Generate App Key

## Payload Examples

### Create Event

POST /api/events

```json
{
  "title": "Laravel Conference 2025",
  "description": "A community event for Laravel developers.",
  "country_id": 1,
  "date": "2025-06-15",
  "capacity": 100
}
```

### Register Attendee

POST /api/attendees

```json
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "phone": "+1234567890"
}
```

### Book Event

POST /api/bookings

```json
{
  "attendee_id": 1,
  "event_id": 1
}
```

Validations ensure:
- The event is not full
- The attendee has not already booked the event

## Authentication

Not implemented, but the structure assumes:

- Authenticated users are required to create, update, or delete events
- Guests are allowed to register as attendees and book events

A future implementation can use Laravel Sanctum or Passport.

## Directory Structure

- app/Http/Controllers: Controllers
- app/Http/Requests: Validation classes
- app/Services: Business logic
- app/Models: Eloquent models
- app/Http/Resources: API response formatting
- tests/Feature: Feature tests
- database/factories: Model factories
